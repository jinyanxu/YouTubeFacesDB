YouTubeFacesDB
==============

Python module allowing to load the YouTube Faces Database:

http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/

**Description:** The data set contains 3,425 videos of 1,595 different
people. All the videos were downloaded from YouTube. An average of 2.15
videos are available for each subject. The shortest clip duration is 48
frames, the longest clip is 6,070 frames, and the average length of a
video clip is 181.3 frames.

**For TUC users:** the DB is already downloaded on cortex at
``/work/biblio/youtube Faces DB`` (with the spaces). Copy it to your
machine (in ``/scratch``, as it is over 25GB) and uncompress it.
